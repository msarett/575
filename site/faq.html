    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
</center>

<h3>Where is the code for each assignment?</h3>
<blockquote>
    /afs/cs.unc.edu/project/courses/comp575-f15/<b>code/</b>
    <br/>
    Each assignment is in its own pa* directory
    <br/>
    <br/>
    e.g. The first assignment is found in /afs/cs.unc.edu/project/courses/comp575-f15/code/pa0
</blockquote>

<h3>Where do I store my code for each assignment?</h3>
<blockquote>
    /afs/cs.unc.edu/project/courses/comp575-f15/users/<b>your-name</b>
    <br/>
    Each assigment should have its own pa* directory
    <br/>
    <br/>
    e.g. Your first assignment should be stored in /afs/cs.unc.edu/project/courses/comp575-f15/users/<b>your-name</b>/pa0
</blockquote>

<h3>Can I use the department's computers to write/compile my code?</h3>
<blockquote>
    Yes.
    <br/>
    <pre>
    ssh -X <b>your-name</b>@classroom.cs.unc.edu</b>
    cd /afs/cs.unc.edu/project/courses/comp575-f15/users/<b>your-name</b>
    </pre>
    If you need to start on a new assignment (e.g. pa# where # is 0 or 1 or whatever), you'll need to first copy the source from code into your local dir
    <pre>
    cp -R ../code/pa# .
    </pre>
    Once you have copied it, you can just work on it in your local copy in your pa# directory
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you need an account, contact John Sopko sopko@cs.unc.edu

<h3>Do I have to use the department's computers?</h3>
<blockquote>
    No. The only actual requirements are:
    <ul>
        <li>You store your final code for each assignment in /afs/cs.unc.edu/project/courses/comp575-f15/users/<b>your-name</b>/pa#</li>
        <li>It <b>can</b> compile successfully using the department's computers (i.e. <b>I</b> can compile and run it).</li>
    </ul>
    Developing locally (on your laptop) is perfectly fine, and may be faster than doing all your work via ssh.
</blockquote>

<h3>How do I compile and run the assignment?</h3>
<blockquote>
    Assuming you're in your directory on /afs...
    <pre>
    > cd pa0
    > make
    > ./image
    </pre>
    You show now have created the PNG files (try 'ls *.png' to see).
    <br/>
    If your remote connection was created with -X (i.e. ssh -X ...) and your local terminal supports X Windows, you can try viewing the files with 'preview'
    <pre>
    > ../../../code/preview *.png
    </pre>
    If that doesn't work, you can always copy the image files to your local machine (laptop)
    <pre>
    # from your local machine
    > scp <b>your-name</b>@classroom.cs.unc.edu:/afs/cs.unc.edu/project/courses/comp575-f15/users/<b>your-name</b>/pa0/*.png .
    </pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>What if my laptop is Windows?</h3>
<blockquote>
    Go to software.unc.edu and download the "SSH/SFTP Secure Shell"
</blockquote>

<h3>I'm a grad student. Will I get "credit" for 575?</h3>
<blockquote>
    Grad students can get credit for any course numbered greater than 400, so yes.
